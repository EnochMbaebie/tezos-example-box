Tezos Example Box
=================

This box contains a simple `SimpleStorage` contract to display the basics of Tezos
integration with Truffle.

## Installation

1. Install Truffle globally. Make sure you install `truffle@alphaTez`.
    ```
    npm install -g truffle@alphaTez
    ```

2. Download the box. This also takes care of installing the necessary dependencies.
    ```
    truffle unbox tezos-example
    ```

3. Compile and migrate the smart contract.
    ```
    truffle compile
    truffle migrate
    ```
